# Modular Beam Connections (No Welding)

This repository documents my 2023 entry for a design challenge focused on **rapid construction of buildings without the need for welding**. The goal was to find structural connection methods that are strong, modular, and easy to assemble/disassemble in the field. Although this project did not win the challenge, it represents an alternative approach to connecting beams securely while maintaining flexibility in construction.  

## Concept

The system relies on **custom 3D-printed connectors** and mechanical fasteners that allow I-beams and other structural members to be joined quickly. The connectors are designed to lock beams together from multiple directions, providing stability without welding.  

- ✅ Rapid assembly/disassembly  
- ✅ No specialized welding equipment required  
- ✅ Modular and reusable components  

## 3D Models

The design was created in CAD and exported as 3D models. Below are some previews:

## Status

This is a **conceptual project** and not yet tested in real-world construction. It is shared here as a resource and inspiration for further exploration of **modular building techniques**.
