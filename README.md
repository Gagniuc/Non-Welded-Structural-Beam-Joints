# Modular Beam Connections (No Welding)

This repository documents my 2023 entry for a design challenge focused on **rapid construction of buildings without the need for welding**. The goal was to find structural connection methods that are strong, modular, and easy to assemble/disassemble in the field. Although this project did not win the challenge, it represents an alternative approach to connecting beams securely while maintaining flexibility in construction. This beam system has never been 3D printed or physically tested; it exists only as a concept, designed and modeled digitally. I am curious whether a 3D print would function as intended.

## Concept

The system relies on **custom 3D-printed connectors** and mechanical fasteners that allow I-beams and other structural members to be joined quickly. The connectors are designed to lock beams together from multiple directions, providing stability without welding. Also, the assembly relies on gravity, as the cross-shaped clamps are designed to self-lock and secure the beams in place without additional welding.

- ✅ Rapid assembly/disassembly  
- ✅ No specialized welding equipment required  
- ✅ Modular and reusable components  

## 3D Models

The design was created in CAD and exported as 3D models. Below are some previews:

## Status

This is a **conceptual project** and not yet tested in real-world construction. It is shared here as a resource and inspiration for further exploration of **modular building techniques**.
