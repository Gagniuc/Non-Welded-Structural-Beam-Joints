# Modular Beam Connections (No Welding)

This repository documents my 2021 entry for a design challenge focused on **rapid construction of buildings without the need for welding**. The goal was to find structural connection methods that are strong, modular, and easy to assemble/disassemble in the field. Although this project did not win the challenge, it represents an alternative approach to connecting beams securely while maintaining flexibility in construction. This beam system has never been 3D printed or physically tested; it exists only as a concept, designed and modeled digitally. I am curious whether a 3D print would function as intended.

## Concept

The system relies on **custom 3D-printed connectors** and mechanical fasteners that allow I-beams and other structural members to be joined quickly. The connectors are designed to lock beams together from multiple directions, providing stability without welding. Also, the assembly relies on gravity, as the cross-shaped clamps are designed to self-lock and secure the beams in place without additional welding.

- ✅ Rapid assembly/disassembly  
- ✅ No specialized welding equipment required  
- ✅ Modular and reusable components  

## 3D Models

The design was created in CAD and exported as 3D models. Below are some previews:

The system is designed to join <i>I-beams</i> and <i>perforated plates</i> without welding, relying instead on custom <i>connectors</i> that slot into place. The main innovation is the <i>cross-shaped clamp</i> that uses gravity and geometry to achieve a <b>self-locking effect</b>.  

The structure is composed of <i>I-beams</i> (red parts) which form the load-bearing skeleton, <i>perforated plates</i> (beige parts) that act as mounting interfaces, <i>cross-shaped clamps</i> (beige connectors) that accept beams from multiple directions and lock them together, and <i>support wedges or pads</i> that secure alignment.  

The mounting principle is simple: the base beams are placed horizontally, then the cross clamp is positioned at the intersection where beams will meet. Each beam is slid into the clamp slots, where the rectangular openings align them automatically. As the beams settle under their own weight, gravity presses them into the connector and the cross geometry prevents lateral movement, creating a <b>self-locking joint</b>.  

Once the base is stabilized, vertical supports can be added in the same way, using additional clamps at higher levels. The perforated plates allow optional bolting if extra rigidity is needed, but the system is intended to function as a weld-free and tool-minimal solution.  

In this way, the assembly relies on <i>gravity</i> and <i>geometric interlocking</i>, with distributed contact surfaces that spread loads evenly instead of concentrating stress on a single welded joint.

## Exploded Assembly Guide  

### <b>Step 1 – Base Preparation</b>  
Place two <i>I-beams</i> parallel on the ground to define the base.  
Ensure they are level and aligned with the grid reference.  

### <b>Step 2 – Insert Cross-Clamp</b>  
Position a <i>cross-shaped clamp</i> at the intended joint location.  
The clamp has four openings at 90° angles, allowing beams to slide in from multiple directions.  

### <b>Step 3 – Slide Horizontal Beams</b>  
Insert the <i>horizontal I-beams</i> into the clamp slots until they meet at the center.  
The geometry of the clamp ensures correct alignment.  
<i>Gravity</i> helps the beams settle firmly into position, beginning the self-lock effect.

### <b>Step 4 – Add Vertical Beams</b>  
Place an <i>upright I-beam</i> into the vertical slot of the cross clamp.  
The connector hugs the vertical member while staying anchored by the horizontal beams below.

### <b>Step 5 – Add Locking Pads/Wedges (Optional)</b>  
Insert the <i>small pads or wedges</i> into the clamp openings if extra tightening is needed.  
These elements prevent micro-movements and improve load distribution.  

### <b>Step 6 – Reinforce with Perforated Plates (Optional)</b>  
Align <i>perforated plates</i> along the faces of the I-beams.  
Use bolts or pins through the holes for additional rigidity.  
This step is optional, as the gravity-locking geometry already secures the beams.

## Assembly Principle  

The mounting process is based on <b>gravity</b> and <b>geometry</b>:  
- <b>Gravity</b> presses the beams downward into the clamps.  
- <b>Cross-shaped clamp geometry</b> ensures beams self-lock at 90° intersections.  
- <b>Perforated plates</b> provide flexibility for reinforcement without welding.

## Status  

This system has <b>never been 3D printed or physically tested</b>; it exists only as a concept, designed and modeled digitally.  
I am curious whether a real 3D print would function <i>as intended</i>.  



## Status

This is a **conceptual project** and not yet tested in real-world construction. It is shared here as a resource and inspiration for further exploration of **modular building techniques**.
